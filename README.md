#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11


   Preffered OS: Windows 11

   "Steps to install windows 11"
   1. Download the Windows 11 ISO file from the official Microsoft website.
   -visit the windows 11 download page (https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)
   2. Create a bootable USB drive using Rufus or any other tool.
   3. Insert the USB drive and restart your computer.
   4. Press the key to access the boot menu (usually F2, F12, or Del).
   5. Select the USB drive as the boot device.
   6. Follow the installation wizard to complete the installation process.


2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   
   How to install Visual studio code
   1. Visit the Visual Studio Code download page (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
   2. Click on the download link for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
   3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard to complete the installation process.
   4. Launch Visual Studio Code and explore its features and extensions.


3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   Setting up version control system
   1. Download and install Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   2. Create a GitHub account (https://github.com/join)
   3. Initialize a Git repository for your project using the command `git init`
   4. Create a new repository on GitHub and link it to your local repository using the command
   `git remote add origin <repository-url>`
   5. Make your first commit using the command `git add .` and `git commit
   -m "Initial commit"`
   6. Push your changes to the remote repository using the command `git push -u origin
   master`




4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  Installing Necessary Programming languages and runtimes
  1. Visit the Python download page (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  2. Click on the download link for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
  3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard to complete the installation process.
  4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `python --version
  5. Install any additional libraries or dependencies required for your project using pip (Python package manager)
  6. Install any other necessary programming languages and runtimes (e.g., Java, Node
  js, etc.) following similar steps.



5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   Installing package managers
   1. Python: pip comes bundled with Python, so you don't need to install it
   separately.
   2. Verify pip installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing
   `pip --version`
   3. Install any additional package managers required for your project (e.g., npm
   for Node.js, etc.) following similar steps.


6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
   Configure a database
   1. Visit the MySQL download page (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
   2. Click on the download link for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
   3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard to complete the installation process.
   4. Configure the database by creating a new user and database for your project.
   5. Verify the database connection using a tool like MySQL Workbench or the command-line client


7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

   Setting up Development Environments and visualization
   1. Install Docker (https://www.docker.com/get-docker) or a virtual machine
   2. Create a new Docker image or virtual machine for your project
   3. Configure the environment by installing necessary dependencies and tools
   4. Verify the environment by running a test project or command
   5. Use the virtualized environment for development, testing, and deployment


8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.
   Explore Extensions and plugins
   1. Visit the extension marketplace for your chosen text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual
   Studio Code Extensions, IntelliJ IDEA Plugins, etc.)
   2. Browse through available extensions and plugins, and read reviews and descriptions
   3. Install and configure extensions that enhance functionality and productivity
   4. Verify the functionality of installed extensions and plugins
   5. Explore additional extensions and plugins as needed for specific tasks or projects


9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

   

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
